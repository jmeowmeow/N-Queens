Solution attempts to Allan Bogh's informal N-Queens challenge.

Below text is copied from his introduction.  It reads like a more general 
challenge, e.g. to job applicants, but the text does not appear to be 
available via Google search:

The n-Queens problem is a programming exercise that is similar in nature to the 8-queens problem but with any number of queens on a board. The challenge becomes apparent as you place more queens on the board. The more queens there are the more memory and recursions you will use, which also takes time. 

This programming exercise is meant to challenge your ability to not only place N-queens on an NxN board, but to do it in a memory and time limit using a brute force placement routine.

Please don't copy someone else's code, and remember this sentence:

These brute-force algorithms are computationally manageable for n = 8, but would be intractable for problems of n â‰¥ 20, as 20! = 2.433 * 1018.

Rules

* Queens must fill every column and row of the board without interfering with one another
* Queens interfere if there is another one in the same column, row, or diagonal
* Time limit: 30 seconds. You fail if you cannot complete random placement of the queens in 30 seconds
* Memory limit : 128MB. You fail if the amount of memory used is over 128MB.
* No genetic algorithms or AI
* Must be brute force (think loops)
* Must use recursion
* Any programming language
* Must be able to draw a grid and markers for queens (web-based or console-based)
* Code must be shared via GitHub (public GitHub)
* Applicants cannot use company time
* Applicants are judged based on the maximum number of queens that can be placed before maxing out the time or memory limits.
